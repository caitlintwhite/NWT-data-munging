# note: this script copies over script worked out in other R scripts for the sole purpose of exporting statistical results, tables and figures for Tim Seastedt (to avoid exporting a bunch of figs and tables as CVSs from R)
# see R scripts replicat_ts_results.R, analyze_ts_dats.R, and addnuts_figs.R for lengthier scripts that go through the analysis weeds
# addnuts_figs.R contains figure generation for NWT poster for self-study (ms contains slightly different NMDS figs [earlier versions])

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r import d}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
